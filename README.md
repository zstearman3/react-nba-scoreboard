## React NBA Scoreboard

This app displays a single day's NBA games in a (lightly) interactive format using react. The project will run as is with games from 8/01/2020. If you would like to see games from another day, you can run the `python scripts/get_schedule.py` from the root directory to change the info in the data.json file. This app will only handle past days with completed games.
